# Exercise 2

Create a new test or extend "Renders the Calculator" to ensure that the component's label is also rendered correctly, following the list below.

> TIP: If you choose to extend the test, you can store the components DOM reference in a variable and use it to check both if it's on the screen and if it has the correct content.
> Having the correct content already implies that the component has been rendered on the Screen, but, for learning purposes, do the two steps.

Component Labels:
- Result: 0
- Add Button: Add
- Subtract Button: Subtract
- Multiply Button: Mutiply
- Divide Button: Divide
