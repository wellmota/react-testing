# Exercise 5

Create an auxiliary function to do the numbers input job and reduce the code repetition.
This auxiliary function need to get the number inputs and fire the change events.

You can use function parameters to set different numbers for each operation, just be careful to also change the expectation to match the numbers used.

> EXTRA: You can also pass the reference of your button to that function and reduce even more the code repetition.
